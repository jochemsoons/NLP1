#### Note:

We transformed the code written in the colab notebook to a repository containing multiple files, as we found this a more practical way of working on this project and running the code. We have also included the .ipynb notebook in this folder in case this might help with grading our work.

## Instructions of usage

We provide an environment file in environment.yml which you might use to run our code:

> conda env create -f environment.yml
>
> conda activate nlp1
